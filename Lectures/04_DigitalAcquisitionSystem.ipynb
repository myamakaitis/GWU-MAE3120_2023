Most modern computerized data acquisition system (DAS) acquire data at fixed time interval (or time increment), making the data discrete in time.  With your knowledge of Fourier transform, you can now realize that this finite sampling rate will set restrictions on the maximal frequency content that can be recorded with the DAS (the Nyquist Shannon sampling rate theorem).\n",

In other words, the amplitude is now discretized as well.  In short, each datum stored in a computer has been discretized in amplitude and time.  \n",

In communication, this enables to send multiple signals with a single cable.  Multiplexing can be accomplished in several manners.
