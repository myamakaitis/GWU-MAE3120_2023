    "# 08 Design of experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "DOE, DOX, or experimental design is an entire field of expertise with dedicated courses in the EMSE department for example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments aim to test variations of a system under conditions that are hypothetize to create the variations.  In other words, it is the study of a system output (_dependent/output variables_ ) by controlling the input conditions (_independent/input variables_ ) in a predetermined way.  Additionally, there are _control variables_ that must be kept constant or monitored to prevent external factors from affecting the experiment results.  In an experiment, by design the input variables are controlled.  In a quasi-experiment, natural conditions are monitored while the output variables are observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the goal of an experiment are set the input variables range or discrete values to test the system and monitor the system output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main concerns of DOE are:\n",
    "- Validity of results\n",
    "\n",
    "Did I test the system over a range of input parameters for which it will be used?  Can I do a wind tunnel test of a model aircraft at the same Mach and Reynolds numbers expected in flight conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "''The first step is clearly defining what it is you're after, because without knowing that, you'll never get it.''\n",
    "Halle Berry, actress\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Are the results consistent?  It is necessary to perform repeat runs to test reliability.  Repeat runs enable to perform ensemble averaging and identify potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on published report (or scientific manuscript), can another group reproduce the same experimental conditions and obtain similar results?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements will have inherent variations and measurement uncertainty.  If we are dealing with a nondeterministic stationary system, datasets must be sufficiently large to be satistically converged in order to have estimate of populations statistics with confidence levels.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Designing an experiments involves several steps that must be treated symbiotically.  Here is a simplified highlight of those steps.  Remember that when you have to conduct an experiment, you have incompressible parameters: your budget, timeline, and expertize.  \n",

    "\n",
    "This is sometimes the hardest part. \n",

    "## Test Matrix design\n",
    "This module is focused on methodologies to determine the optimal number of experimental runs, ie the test matrix.  Here we are looking for the optimum output/dependent variable ($X$) as a function of input/independent variables ($a, b, c, ...$).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to determine the minimal number of runs to perform to save on cost and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input parameters can be dependent (i.e. $a$ affects $b$) or independent of each others (i.e. $a$ has no effect on $b$). Dependence/independence between the parameters will affect the design of the test matrix significantly.  This is best visualized with the graphs below for a function $X(a,b)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/IndependentInputVar.png\" width=\"360\">\n",
    "This plot is an _isocontour plot_.  The lines are contours for which $X$ is constant. Here if one changes _one parameter at a time_ we keep $b$ constant and find the optimum for $a$.  Then keeping $a$ at this value, one finds the optimum for $b$.  We can then iterate, keeping $b$ to its optimal value and optimizing for $a$.  If the variables are indepdendent from each other (like in the graph above), we should already be at the optimum for $a$, so the iteration will stop.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case when the two variables are not independent of each other we are in the case below.  Here the isocontour lines are titled with respect to the axes.\n",
    "<img src=\"img/DependentInputVar.png\" width=\"360\">\n",
    "Here if we use the _one parameter at a time_ approach, we will first find a local optimum for $a$, keeping $b$ constant.  Then we keep $a$ constant optimize for $b$.  When doing another iteration, we will reach another optimal value for $a$ and we must continue the iteration, which can be tedious.\n",
    "\n",
