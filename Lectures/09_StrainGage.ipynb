    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "We have related the change in cross sectional area to the transversal strain.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within the elastic regime, strain is typically within the range $10^{-6} - 10^{-3}$, in fact strain is expressed in unit of microstrain, with a 1 microstrain = $10^{-6}$.  Therefore, changes in resistances will be of the same order.  If one were to measure resistances, we will need a dynamic range of 120 dB, whih is typically very expensive.  Instead, one uses the Wheatstone bridge to transform the change in resistance to a voltage, which is easier to measure and does not require such a large dynamic range."

In practice, this means that is a beam is a in tension, then a strain gage mounted on the branch 1 or 3 of the Wheatstone bridge will produce a positive voltage, while a strain gage mounted on branch 2 or 4 will produce a negative voltage.
