    "## A brief history of measurement (length)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ancient Egypt, (~3,000 BC) people used a measure called a CUBIT.  This word comes from a Latin word “cubitum” which meant elbow and it was the length of a person’s outstretched forearm -  from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger.  It was based on the Pharaoh’s body: the ROYAL CUBIT.  A stick was marked with this distance and copies were distributed to merchants throughout the land.  When the Pharaoh died, a new Pharaoh took the throne, a new Royal Cubit came into being, and a new stick and it’s copies had to be made and sent across the land.  Plus, there were OTHER problems:  The lengths that people wanted to measure were sometimes shorter or longer than a cubit.  So other lengths like the PALM, DIGIT, and FOOT were used.  7 PALMS was the same as 1 CUBIT.  The ROYAL FOOT was equal to about 18 fingers or ⅔ of a Royal Cubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/EgyptCubitStick.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "<img src=\"img/EgyptCubitStick_2.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside the Ancient Egyptians, people throughout the Mediterranean used parts of their bodies to create units of measurement.  Mediterranean sailors used Fathoms to measure depth.  The Hebrew people of long ago used a measurement called a SPAN.  Hand spans are still a unit used to measure horses!  The people of Ancient Greece adapted the Egyptian-Hebrew measurements and added more measurements based upon multiples of fingers.  Ancient Romans created a measurement meant based on the width of the thumb or “uncia” in Latin.  That’s where the word for INCH comes from.  Roman armies measured the distance from one step to another using PACES.  A PACE was equal to 2 Egyptian cubits and is still used to describe speed in foot races.  The word MILE comes from the Latin word “milliare,” a distance of 1,000 paces covered by the Roman army at a forced march.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/BodyLengthUnits.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Roman empire spread, the Roman measuring units became the accepted system of measurement throughout Europe.  A Roman FOOT was equal to 12 UNCIA.  These uncia came to England and over time became INCHES.  Like the Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt, the King of England at the time also wanted to STANDARDIZE (or make the same) the units of measurement across the land based on his own body.  A royal decree went out: a YARD was to be the distance from the nose to the tip of the middle finger of the outstretched arm...or about 3 FEET.  From this time, all units were derived from the King’s foot and yard.  The English Mile was derived from that.  This English or Customary system spread back down through Europe and across the ocean to North America with the English who arrived here.  As trade and communication increased again, once again a more uniform or regulated system was needed.  It took several hundred years for the Customary system to become more and more dependable and standardized.  In 1855, a new distance for a yard was formalized.  This was still about the size of the original Roman yard.  Since then all of the other units of measurement for length have been derived from multiplications and divisions of the Yard.  1 Inch was 1/36 of a yard.  1 Foot was ⅓ yard.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/EnglishLengthUnits.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "While the English or Customary system came to be widely used in Europe, and is still used here in the United States, today there is another widely used system of measurement that is not based on the measurements of the human body.  It’s beginnings can be found in the 1600s in Europe, when people began to talk about finding better STANDARDS for measurement.  In the 1790s, a group of French scientists decided to create a new standard of measurement that would be unchangeable.  The name for the unit of measure chosen was the METER; it was based upon a measurement of the Earth.  The system they developed is called the METRIC SYSTEM and it is still in use today, throughout France, Europe and almost every nation in the world.  All scientists use the Metric system because it is the most precise.  The length of the meter was taken to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator along a line of longitude near Paris, France.  The word meters comes from the Greek word “metron” which means to measure.  The metric system is based on multiples of 10.\n",

    "__Uncertainty analysis__ is an extremely important tool and step in experiments and we are going to spend a significant amount of time on it during the class.  This analysis is performed typically in the experimental planning phase (to help in determining the appropriate components to use in our instrumentation chain see in the first figure).  An extensive analysis is also performed after the campaign to characterize the actual uncertainties in the measurement.\n",

    "When selecting an instrument for a measurement, one has many options.  Ideally, one would like to select a system that will meet our requirements for the measurement (such as expected range, but also for uncertainty) while not breaking the bank... Luckily manufacturers report a lot of data with their sensor/transducer that can help us in making an educated guess of the expected performance without having to characterize it ourselves.  Here is an example from Omega Scientific for a pressure transducer:\n",

    "If we recall our previous definitions for errors, you will remark that they are the same than the two terms introduced above and imply that we compare the instrument readings to the true, known, value.  However, in most cases, we do not know the true value and instead we are only confident that we are within a certain range ($\\pm$) of the true value.  Therefore to be consistent with the definitions introduced so far, we should use the term uncertainty and not error, when describing experimental results (except for a few cases).\n",

Note for digital instrument, resolution is associated with the number of digits on display, ie a 5 digit Digital Multi-Meter (DMM) has better resolution than a 4 digit DMM.
