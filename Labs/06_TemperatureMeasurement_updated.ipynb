    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermistors are temperature sensors whose resistance changes as the temperature changes. They are very accurate and can detect small temperature changes. Thermistors find uses in many applications including automotive to measure ambient or coolant fluid temperatures. The thermistor that will be used for this lab is a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor since as the temperature increases, the resistance value decreases and vice versa. For this thermistor, the nominal resistance of 10 kΩ corresponds to a temperature of 25°C. Any temperature above 25°C produces a resistance smaller than 10 kΩ and temperatures below produce resistances greater than 10 kΩ. The thermistor data sheet has been given to you, and it gives information about the expected resistances at various temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical NTC thermistors are non-linear and resemble an exponentially decaying function. For very small temperature changes the change in resistance can be approximated linearly with the change in resistance using a correlation coefficient. However, over larger temperature ranges the Steinhart-Hart equation, given below, is used where R is the resistance of the thermistor at the current temperature in Ω, T is the current temperature in Kelvin, and a, b, and c are constants determined experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{T} = a + b \\ln R + c (\\ln R)^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative form of the equation can also be used which does not require solving for the experimental constants. Instead, a $\\beta$ value parameter is given in the data sheet for the thermistor to use with the equation below. Where $R_0$ is the resistance of the thermistor at reference temperature $T_0$ in Ω, $\\beta$ is the parameter given in the Data Sheet in Kelvin, and $T_0$ is the reference temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = R_0 e^{\\large \\beta \\left(\\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_0}\\right)}$$"

    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab there are questions to be answered on your lab report for each part. Make sure you pay attention to what the procedure requires you to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part I - Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "To do measurements on a Wheatstone bridge it is necessary to use a DAQ device with a differential input – the measured signal is $V_o = V_o^+-V_o^-$. For this, we will use the NI-9211 module (specifications in Appendix B). In addition to being able to measure thermocouple inputs, the NI-9211 module can measure differential inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the ***DAQ*** Jupyter Notebook located in the *Labs* folder and configure the `acquire` function with the additional parameters listed in *Steps 2-4*. <br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set the `daq_name` to the appropriate value for the location of the *NI 9211* card (most likely `'cDAQ1Mod4'`). <br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set the `mod_type` to `'pr'`.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part II - Voltage Divider\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/VoltageDivider.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "With thermistors, you should be using the Wheatstone bridge for the measurements; however, to simplify the circuitry, we will only use a voltage divider for acquiring the signal. Build two voltage dividers each made of a thermistor ($R_2$) and a 10 kΩ resistor ($R_1$), as pictured in the image above.\n",
    "\n",
    " - __Put both Thermistors on long wires with croc clips.__  This will allow you to move the thermistors freely. What other reasons exist for putting both on long wires? What is the purpose of using two thermistors? Discuss this in your report.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Part III - Thermistor Data Sheet Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "You will do this part at home for the lab report.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the data from the data sheet choose 3 points and calculate the constants a, b, and c from the Steinhart-Hart equation. Verify the values that you calculated for a, b, and c by picking two points (not the ones used in determining a, b, and c) and calculate the corresponding temperature.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Verify that the $\\beta$ parameter value given for this thermistor on the data sheet satisfies the second equation given in the intro, by solving for R at temperatures of 0, 50, and 100°C.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Plot the two curves on the same graph. Is there a difference in the accuracy of the two methods? If so, which one is more accurate?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following parts use the following values of the coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 1.305×10-3, b = 2.143×10-4, c = 9.709×10-8\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part IV - Temperature Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start with the measurements. Make sure to save your data to file appropriately by configuring the `acquire` function. You will need the data to plot them for your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the proper acquisition rate and number of samples. Discuss your choice in the lab report. If needed, modify the plot update rate using the `time_sep` parameter of the `acquire` function. By default, the live plot updates every `1` second. It cannot update at any faster rate. This value does not need to be changed unless you are acquiring data for a long period of time and/or at a high sampling rate (> 15 seconds). If you are acquiring data for more than 1 minute, this value should be changed to a number around `30`<br><p></p>\n",

    "- Turn on the power supply to excite the voltage divider. Set it up to $\\pm$ 0.5 V.  Allow the voltage to settle<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check the voltage output in your oscilopscope.<br><p></p> \n",
    "    - Ideally you want a 0 V output at room temperature.  You may need to change the input voltage to allow this.  Remember the dynamic range of the DAQ. <br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will now place your thermistor (using some tape) near the exhaust of the computer fan.<br><p></p> \n",
    "\n",
    "- If everything is plugged correctly and your function is configured properly, you should notice a slow increase in the output voltage. If you do not see the voltage (temperature) curve on the measurement displays, remember to change the limits from +/-1.0 V to larger values, or to turn on auto scale Y (if you have no mistakes in your settings, you should expect the temperature to be around 20°C). To change the limits of the waveform, just double click on the values and enter the new ones.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember you can always troubleshoot your system with the oscilloscope.<br><p></p>\n",

    "### Part V - Time Response Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's focus more on the time response measurement of the probe. Again, make sure to save your data to file for estimating the time constant in a post processing phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the proper acquisition rate and number of samples. Discuss your choice in the lab report.<br><p></p>\n",

    "- You will now place your thermistor in an ice bath of temperature 0°C. <br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Record how much time it takes for the thermistor to reach the temperature of the ice bath, do not forget to save the data to file. Look into your notes on 1st order time response to determine the time constant $\\tau$. <br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove the thermistor from the bath and place it on the desk.<br><p></p>\n",
