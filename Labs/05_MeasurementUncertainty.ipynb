    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory you will explore the sources of uncertainties in the measurements using digital multi-meters or DMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DMM, the accuracy is given in the datasheet, Appendix A, and the resolution is expressed in significant digit. For the Agilent 34405A used in this lab, the resolution is 5.5 digits. The first “5” represents full digits, i.e. they can display from 0-9. The “0.5” represents the first digit of the reading. In this case, 0.5, means the first digit can represent 0 or 1. Therefore, the number of counts for this multimeter is 200,000 and its resolution is ± ½ the last digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating sources of uncertainties, or doubts, in datasets is very important to have established level of confidence in the reported data. The most obvious and significant sources of doubt are: inaccuracy of the calibrator’s output value, repeatability in the measurements, and resolution of the instrument. However, many other factors contribute also to the overall uncertainty: ambient temperature effects, electromagnetic noise, operator errors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating uncertainties in measurements, rules have been established internationally. You will follow them in this lab. The detailed rules can be found in the “Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement”, or “GUM” [1]. A shortened version can be in found in [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the GUM nomenclature, two types of uncertainties are defined:<br><p></p>\n",
    "- Type A: They are evaluated by statistical analysis of series of observations<br><p></p>\n",
    "- Type B: They are evaluated by means others than the statistical analysis of series of observations.<br><p></p>\n",
    "- If uncertainties are not Type A, they are Type B.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Type B uncertainties are evaluated by analytical model of a transducer and its boundary conditions or from calibration certificates. Type A and B differ from random and systematic uncertainties traditionally used in engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard uncertainty, $u_i$**: uncertainty of the result of a measurement expressed as a standard deviation. It can be thought as ± one standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combined standard uncertainty, $u_m$**: standard uncertainty of the result of a measurement when that result is obtained from the values of a number of other quantities. It is calculated as root sum of the squares of the elemental standard uncertainties and pertains to ± one standard deviation (63% coverage factor):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_c = \\sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + ... + u_N^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One should be careful when using this formula that all the standard uncertainties have the same units and coverage factor, or one will introduce errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expanded uncertainty, $u_m$**: Usually, uncertainty is reported with a larger confidence level, such as 95% or 99%. The expanded uncertainty is related to the combined standard uncertainty by a **coverage coefficient, $k$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_m = k u_c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a large sample, e.g. more than 30 independent measurements, the coverage coefficient is given by the normal distribution. In this case a $k = 2$ for 95% confidence level. However, if you have 30 or less measurements, your coverage factor will be given by the Student t-distribution, which was introduced in the statistics review lecture. You will also need materials covered in that lecture for the remainder of the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will see how to calculate the two types of uncertainties, how to allocate a value for the coverage coefficient, and how to improve the accuracy of an instrument by calibrating it."

    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the measurement of resistances you will determine how to calculate Type A and Type B uncertainties and the overall uncertainty of the measurement. To be able to combine all the uncertainties, they must all have the same units, i.e. they can either be expressed as percent error or in the unit of the measurand. Here, you will use this second scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part I - Type A Uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, you will use one 0.1% accuracy 22 Ω resistor and acquire $n = 10$ measurements of its resistance with the Agilent DMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step before accomplishing any measurements is to remove residual noise that might be in your instrument and will affect your data. This is called doing the zero, i.e. you are removing a systematic source of error.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Touch the 2 measurement leads together. The meter should read a value close to zero. This value corresponds to the ‘residual resistance’, that is the internal resistance of the machinery and the wires. Record this ‘residual resistance’ and subtract it from all following measurements.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attach banana cables to both ends of the resistor.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect the banana cables to the DMM.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Turn on the DMM and measure the resistor's resistance at least 10 times. <br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Record the resistance for further calculations.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) and standard deviation ($s$). <br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **experimental standard error** (also called the standard uncertainty of the mean), $u_1$, is calculated from the same formula than for estimating the population mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_1 = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the number of degrees of freedom for this statistics?<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the type of probability distribution function?<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There might be more than one contributor to Type A uncertainties. If we had other uncertainty to evaluate, we will use the symbol $u_2$, $u_3$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part II - Type B Uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "Type B uncertainties encompass all other uncertainties that cannot be determined statistically during the measurement process. They include, but are not limited to: calibration inaccuracy, limited instrument resolution, environment effects, etc. Here you will explore in details two types of doubts in your measurements: range and reading uncertainties and limitation in the DMM resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In accordance with the convention adopted above, $u_i$ is a standard uncertainty and is defined at ± one standard deviation (i.e. 68% confidence level). In some manufacturer, the reported accuracies can be at 90%, 95%, 99%, etc, which implies that you will have to adjust the reported value to be able to work on your uncertainties at ± one standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have sufficient information to know for sure, you should treat the pdf as a rectangular or uniform distribution, ie values are equally likely. In cases you are only able to estimate the upper and lower limits of uncertainty, the standard uncertainty is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_i = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $a$ the half-width between the lower and upper limits. Here you are lucky, Agilent reports the uncertainties of its instruments to 68% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Range and reading standard uncertainty, $u_2$**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the range the instrument is set at to measure a 22 Ω resistance? In Appendix A, find and report the proper values for the range and reading uncertainties.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the DMM datasheet, what does the “math null enable” (footnote [3]) mean? In the future you could use it to automatically correct for the residual resistance.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From this, calculate the measurement uncertainty due to these two sources at 68% confidence level.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the number of degrees of freedom for this uncertainty? While for Type A uncertainties this was easy to estimate, for Type B, it is often considered as infinite, such as for specifications reported by the manufacturer.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the type of probability distribution function?<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**DMM resolution, $u_3$**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Measurements include errors due to limited resolution of the display panel. This is usually taken as one half of the least significant digit, LSD. Remember, however, the standard uncertainties must be expressed at ± 1 sigma, i.e. you need to know the probability distribution function of this uncertainty.<br><p></p>\n",

    "### Part III - Combined Standard Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "You have now identified and calculated the main sources of uncertainties in your test. It is good practice, however, to identify and document other possible sources of uncertainties that you deem insignificant. In a first step, you will estimate the combined standard uncertainty and later use it to calculate the expanded uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the standard combined uncertainty at 68% confidence level.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To help visualize the various sources of uncertainties and their respective contributions to the overall system it is convenient to summarize your data in a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source of Uncertainty |   Type   | $u_i$ | Uncertainty value (Unit) | Sensitivity coefficient ($c_i$) | Type of pdf | Standard uncertainty (unit) | Degrees of freedom ($\\nu_i$) |\n",

    "3. Complete the table above, except for the last column, you will see how to do it next. We have not defined the sensitivity coefficient, $c_i$. It relates the change in measurement response divided by the corresponding change in input. It is a value of the importance of each sources of uncertainties on the overall measurement. Usually this coefficient is set to 1, except when there is an analytical formula relating the measurand to the results. Here we will use $c_i = 1$. In your report, justify the type of pdf you expect the combined uncertainty to follow. The cells with “-” cannot be completed.<br><p></p>\n",

    "4. To calculate the overall effective degree of freedom (last row and last column cell), the Welch-Satterthwaite formula is used:\n",
